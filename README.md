# RateMyRental SF
This is a full-stack web application for rating rentals in San Francisco. Touring a rental in person can tell you a lot, but there are some things that may not come across. Do the upstairs neighbors make lots of noise in the evenings? Is there a barking dog who lives next door? Maybe there is lots of street noise? RateMyRental SF is a centralized review platform for tenants to pass on information to other perspective tenants.
